In SQL Challenge, I modeled, engineered, and analyzed 6 CSV files regarding employee and workplace data. I was able to relate and anaylze the different relationships between subjects such as employee ids, salaries, departments, and role titles. 

This repository cosnsits of an image file of my ERD displaying the relationships between the 6 CSV files, a queries.sql file that consists of my code to create the 6 original tables and query the 8 different data anaylsis quesitons. In the query table folder are 8 different CSV files, one file displaying the resulting table for each question.
